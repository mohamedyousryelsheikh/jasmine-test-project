# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


# test cases that are done
* checking that all feeds have a url and name
* checking that menu is toggling correctly
* checking there is atleast single entry when page is loaded
* checking content changes on loading the rest of data

# Steps to run
* open index.html file located on the root of the project, on loading the page on the browser, jasmine will   run to check on the test cases that are developed.
* to check the test cases done you can open jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file
